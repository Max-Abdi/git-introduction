My name is Mohamed Abdirahim. I was born and raised up in Berbera. I am currently living in Hargeisa, Somaliland. In addition to that, It is my honor to mention that I have watched so many interesting movies but ONE of those became unforgettable-- They Call it Troy Movie. I am highly reccomending you to watch that movie. My favourite hobby is travelling because I love discovering new cities and places
around the world. I often save up for months to plan a trip every year. I love friendsâ€™ trips and family outings but solo travelling brings me the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.
